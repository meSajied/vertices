# Vertices
It is a basic project to build server with NodeJs. This project named "Vertices" because, we call vertex found in Graph Algorithm as node sometime. Anyone cannot run the command `npm start` on this messy code. They can just see the code blocks to get an idea.
## Caution
Run `npm install` first as node_modules directory added to `.gitignore`
## Info
This project was learned from **Server-Side NodeJs** on **coursera**.
